  abstract  = "This paper presents the current state of mathematical modelling
               of the electrochemical behaviour of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)
               as they are charged and discharged. It reviews the models
               developed by Newman and co-workers, both in the cases of dilute
               and moderately concentrated electrolytes and indicates the
               modelling assumptions required for their development. Particular
               attention is paid to the interface conditions imposed between
               the electrolyte and the active electrode material; necessary
               conditions are derived for one of these, the Butler--Volmer
               relation, in order to ensure physically realistic solutions.
               Insight into the origin of the differences between various
               models found in the literature is revealed by considering
               formulations obtained by using different measures of the
               electric potential. Materials commonly used for electrodes in
               LIBs are considered and the various mathematical models used to
               describe lithium transport in them discussed. The problem of
               upscaling from models of behaviour at the single electrode
               particle scale to the cell scale is addressed using
               homogenisation techniques resulting in the pseudo-2D model
               commonly used to describe charge transport and discharge
               behaviour in lithium-ion cells. Numerical solution to this model
               is discussed and illustrative results for a common device are
               computed.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Physics-based electrochemical battery models derived
               from porous electrode theory are a very powerful tool for
               understanding lithium-ion batteries, as well as for improving
               their design and management. Different model fidelity, and thus
               model complexity, is needed for different applications. For
               example, in battery design we can afford longer computational
               times and the use of powerful computers, while for real-time
               battery control (e.g. in electric vehicles) we need to perform
               very fast calculations using simple devices. For this reason,
               simplified models that retain most of the features at a lower
               computational cost are widely used. Even though in the
               literature we often find these simplified models posed
               independently, leading to inconsistencies between models, they
               can actually be derived from more complicated models using a
               unified and systematic framework. In this review, we showcase
               this reductive framework, starting from a high-fidelity
               microscale model and reducing it all the way down to the single
               particle model, deriving in the process other common models,
               such as the Doyle--Fuller--Newman model. We also provide a
               critical discussion on the advantages and shortcomings of each
               of the models, which can aid model selection for a particular
               application. Finally, we provide an overview of possible
               extensions to the models, with a special focus on thermal
               models. Any of these extensions could be incorporated into the
               microscale model and the reductive framework re-applied to lead
               to a new generation of simplified, multi-physics models.",

  abstract  = "This long awaited and thoroughly updated version of the classic
               text (Plenum Press, 1970) explains the subject of
               electrochemistry in clear, straightforward language for
               undergraduates and mature scientists who want to understand
               solutions. Like its predecessor, the new text presents the
               electrochemistry of solutions at the molecular level. The Second
               Edition takes full advantage of the advances in microscopy,
               computing power, and industrial applications in the quarter
               century since the publication of the First Edition. Such new
               techniques include scanning-tunneling microscopy, which enables
               us to see atoms on electrodes; and new computers capable of
               molecular dynamics calculations that are used in arriving at
               experimental values. Chapter 10 starts with a detailed
               description of what happens when light strikes semi-conductor
               electrodes and splits water, thus providing in hydrogen a clean
               fuel. There have of course been revolutionary advances here
               since the First Edition was written. The book also discusses
               electrochemical methods that may provide the most economical
               path to many new syntheses - for example, the synthesis of the
               textile, nylon. The broad area of the breakdown of material in
               moist air, and its electrochemistry is taken up in the
               substantial Chapter 12. Another exciting topic covered is the
               evolution of energy conversion and storage which lie at the
               cutting edge of clean automobile development. Chapter 14
               presents from a fresh perspective a discussion of
               electrochemical mechanisms in Biology, and Chapter 15 shows how
               new electrochemical approaches may potentially alleviate many
               environmental problems.",
