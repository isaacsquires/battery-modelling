# Interface

This section of the wiki explores the modelling of interfacial dynamics in Li-ion batteries. The main process relevant to charge transport is lithium (de)intercalation at the boundary between the electrode and electrolyte. The standard approach is to use [Butler-Volmer equation](butler-volmer.md) to model this process.

However, there are other approaches that capture more complex interactions.
