# Electrolyte

The electrolyte is the component that allows the lithium ions to move between the electrodes. The electrolyte is normally a lithium salt dissolved in an organic solvent.

The tranport of lithium ions in a liquid electrolyte can be described by [dilute electrolyte theory](dilute-electrolyte.md) and [concentrated electrolyte theory](concentrated-electrolyte.md).
