# Continuity equations

A continuity equation describes the transport of a conserved quantity. In differential form, a general continuity equation can be written as

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{j} = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\phi$ is the conserved quantity, $\mathbf{j}$ is the flux density and $t$ is time.

In a Li-ion battery, charge and mass are important conserved quantities. These generalised continuity equations can be used to derive the more specific transport laws for lithium ions and electrons under certain conditions.
