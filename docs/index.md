# Charge Transport Modelling in Li-ion Batteries

This wiki explores the modelling of charge transport in Li-ion batteries.

## What is a Li-ion battery?

A Li-ion battery (LIB) is a device that converts between chemical energy and electrical energy through a redox reaction of lithium ions at the electrodes.

You can find more information about the fundamentals of Li-ion batteries in the [fundamentals](fundamentals/fundamentals.md) section.

## Charge transport in Li-ion batteries

LIBs are complex, multi-scale systems, with critical phenomena occuring from the nm to mm scale. The behaviour of the battery is dependent on many things, including but not limited to the intrinsic material properties, interfacial dynamics, microstructure, state-of-health, state-of-charge, temperature gradients and operating conditions. These factors create overpotentials that affect the performance of the battery. This wiki will outline the theory behind the charge transport in Li-ion batteries, and how this can be modelled. This can be split into three main sections:

- [Electrode](electrode/electrode.md) - charge transport in the electrode
- [Electrolyte](electrolyte/electrolyte.md) - charge transport in the electrolyte
- [Interface](interface/interface.md) - interfacial dynamics that describe lithium (de)intercalation at the boundary between the electrode and electrolyte
