# Charge Transport Modelling in Li-ion Batteries

This wiki explores the modelling of charge transport in Li-ion batteries.

## What is a Li-ion battery?

A Li-ion battery is a device that converts between chemical energy and electrical energy through a redox reaction of lithium ions at the electrodes.

You can find more information about the fundamentals of Li-ion batteries in the [fundamentals](fundamentals/li-ion-batteries.md) section.

## Charge transport in Li-ion batteries

Li-ion batteries are complex, multi-scale systems, with critical phenomena occuring from the nm to mm scale. There are a wide range of factors, many coupled, that create overpotentials which affects the performance of the battery. A key component of understanding these limiting behaviours is through charge transport modelling. This wiki will outline the theory behind the charge transport in Li-ion batteries, and how this can be modelled. This can be split into three main sections:

- [Electrode](electrode/electrode.md) - charge transport in the electrode
- [Electrolyte](electrolyte/electrolyte.md) - charge transport in the electrolyte
- [Interface](interface/interface.md) - interfacial dynamics that describe lithium (de)intercalation at the boundary between the electrode and electrolyte

## Roadmap

Here is a list of sections that will be added in the future:

- [ ] DFN
- [ ] ECM
- [ ] SPM
- [ ] Finite numerical methods
- [ ] Microscale 3D model
